All changes i make are preceded by comments starting with "ada", so
that they can be easily traced by searching for "ada" in the code.

1. scrollback

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Since i have hardcoded my preferred font into st (see config.h),
   this will only work if:
   a. you either install the same font:
      Fantasque Sans Mono (https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/fantasque-sans-mono)
      Gentoo package: media-fonts/fantasque-sans-mono
   b. you change config.h (line 8) by placing your font of choice.
2. As said by suckless (see below), remember to check config.mk
